Ever since I discovered the power of technology to solve complex business challenges, I have been inspired to bridge the gap between technical solutions and functional needs. With over three years of experience in tech consulting and a solid foundation in Computer Engineering, I specialize in delivering innovative solutions that enhance operational efficiency and optimize business processes.

In my current role as a Product Owner at Vosyn, I lead product strategies for AI-driven solutions, driving user satisfaction through data-driven enhancements. Previously, at Infosys, I implemented Salesforce solutions that improved data quality by 20% and operational efficiency by 25%, while managing over 50 million records seamlessly. My expertise spans CRM systems, process automation, and data analysis using tools like Excel and Tableau.

I bring a unique blend of technical proficiency and business acumen to every project. My passion lies in transforming complex requirements into actionable strategies that deliver measurable results for stakeholders.

Outside of work, I am pursuing a Master of Management at Haskayne School of Business, honing my leadership skills and expanding my strategic perspective. Let’s connect to explore how we can drive impactful change together—reach out to me here or via email at devanshparikh15@gmail.com.
